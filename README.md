# WikiType
WikiType is a typing practice web app based off the superb [TypingClub] web
app.

The goal of WikiType is to allow users to practicing typing using exercises
created from public content on Wikipedia and to let users create and share
their own exercises.

This project is a prototype front-end to the [WikiType API server], although it
currently fetches data directly from the [Wikimedia REST API].
